https://x.com/zackslab/status/2002143095052513349?s=51&t=JsTxSwMxTXa9UPI8fz9H2w,"Physics Explanation,Electrical Engineering,Science Communication","This social media post provides an alternative perspective on understanding electricity, challenging common analogies. The author argues that electricity is fundamentally a wave phenomenon involving electromagnetic (EM) fields, rather than a simple flow of electrons like water through a pipe. The key message is that energy and information are propagated through fields, with electrons playing a secondary role. The post seems intended to offer a more nuanced scientific explanation of electrical principles, potentially aimed at demystifying traditional explanations of electrical current and encouraging a deeper understanding of electromagnetic phenomena."
